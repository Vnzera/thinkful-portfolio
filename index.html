                    <h3>About Luis</h2>
                        <p>I started learning to code when I read about the growing job market for developers. The job
                            description seemed to require researching, methodical and systematic work, logic and a mix
                            of
                            both autonomy and teamwork. These traits appeal to me so I stuck to it. </p>
                        <p>It became obvious that a structured approach was going to be extremely helpful. Thinkful
                            really
                            stood out
                            to me because the curriculum was similar to topics I have already studied and the entire
                            course
                            is online.</p>
                        <p>If you're looking to hire a developer then feel free to reach out! Drop me a message below.
